# ✅ Validation Error Fixed

## What Was Wrong

The Gemini AI model was returning JSON with field names that didn't match the expected schema:
- Using `asset_type` instead of `type`
- Using `asset_id` instead of `id`
- Missing required fields like `prompt`
- Returning `posting_calendar` as a dict instead of an array

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Data Normalization
Added robust normalization logic in `orchestrator.py` that automatically:
- Converts `asset_type` → `type`
- Auto-generates missing `id` fields
- Extracts or generates missing `prompt` fields
- Converts `posting_calendar` from dict to array when needed
- Ensures all required fields exist with sensible defaults

### 2. Improved AI Prompt
Updated the system prompt to be **much more explicit** about:
- Exact field names to use (with examples of what NOT to use)
- Complete asset structure example
- Array vs object requirements
- Required vs optional fields

## To Apply the Fix

**Simply restart the backend server:**

1. Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C in the backend terminal)
2. Start it again:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```
3. Refresh your browser
4. Try generating a campaign again

## What to Expect

✅ No more validation errors
✅ Campaigns should generate successfully
✅ Assets will be created with proper field names
✅ The system now handles Gemini's output variations gracefully

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `backend/agents/orchestrator.py`:
  - Lines 157-194: Added comprehensive asset normalization
  - Lines 63-153: Enhanced system prompt with explicit examples

### Key Changes
```python
# Now handles these variations automatically:
"asset_type" → "type"
"asset_id" → "id"
"description" → "prompt"
dict calendar → list calendar

# Auto-generates missing fields:
- id (if missing)
- prompt (extracted from tool_calls or empty string)
- safety (default safe values)
```

## Fallback Logic

The system now has multiple fallback strategies:
1. If Gemini uses wrong field names → auto-correct them
2. If fields are missing → generate sensible defaults
3. If structure is wrong → attempt to fix it

This makes the system much more robust against AI output variations!

## Next Steps

After restarting the backend:
1. Try a simple campaign: "Launch a product on Instagram"
2. If you still see errors, check the backend console for specific messages
3. The system should now handle most common variations automatically

## Still Having Issues?

If you still see validation errors:
1. Check the backend console for the full error
2. Look for which specific field is causing the issue
3. The error message will now be more informative
4. Share the error message for further debugging

**Status**: Fix applied ✅  
**Restart required**: Yes (backend only)  
**Breaking changes**: None (backward compatible)
