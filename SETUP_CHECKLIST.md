- [ ] API keys have no quotes around them
- [ ] API keys have no extra spaces
- [ ] `.env` file is not named `.env.txt`

### Backend Won't Start
- [ ] Virtual environment is activated (see `(venv)` in terminal)
- [ ] All dependencies installed without errors
- [ ] Port 8000 is not already in use
- [ ] Python version is 3.10 or higher

### Frontend Won't Start

- [ ] No errors in `npm install` output

### Generation Fails
- [ ] Backend terminal shows no errors
- [ ] Frontend browser console shows no errors
- [ ] API keys are valid (not expired/revoked)
- [ ] Internet connection is working

### Images Don't Generate
- [ ] Hugging Face token is valid
- [ ] Waited 30+ seconds (model loading time)
- [ ] Backend terminal shows image generation attempt
- [ ] Check backend terminal for specific error

### "Model is loading" Error

- [ ] Just wait, don't refresh page

## ‚úÖ Performance Checks

- [ ] `.env` file has correct permissions (not world-readable)

## ‚úÖ Optional: Advanced Setup

- [ ] Set up git repository (`git init`)
- [ ] Added `.gitignore` (already included)
- [ ] Created first commit
- [ ] Set up remote repository (GitHub/GitLab)
- [ ] Pushed code (without `.env` file)

## üéâ Success Criteria

You're ready to use the system when:

‚úÖ Backend runs without errors
‚úÖ Frontend loads in browser
‚úÖ Test campaign generates successfully
‚úÖ All assets display correctly
‚úÖ Export downloads ZIP file
‚úÖ No console errors

## üìû Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "GOOGLE_API_KEY not found"
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure `.env` file exists in root directory
2. Check file is named `.env` not `.env.txt`
3. Verify API key is on correct line
4. Restart backend server

### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**:
1. Ensure virtual environment is activated
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again
3. Check Python version is 3.10+

### Issue: Frontend shows "Failed to fetch"
**Solution**:
1. Ensure backend is running on port 8000
2. Check CORS is enabled in backend
3. Verify proxy settings in `vite.config.js`

### Issue: Images not generating
**Solution**:
1. Verify Hugging Face token is valid
2. Wait 30 seconds for model to load
3. Check backend terminal for errors
4. Try regenerating the asset

### Issue: Slow generation
**Solution**:
1. First generation is always slower (model loading)
2. Subsequent generations are faster
3. Free tier APIs have rate limits
4. Consider upgrading to paid tiers for speed

## üìù Notes

- First campaign generation takes 2-3 minutes (model loading)
- Subsequent campaigns are faster (~90 seconds)
- Free tier limits: ~30-50 campaigns per day
- Keep both terminals open while using the app
- Press Ctrl+C in terminals to stop servers
